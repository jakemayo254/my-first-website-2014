# My First Website (2014)

This project is a personal time capsuleâ€”my very first attempt at building a website back in 2014, during my first semester as a computer science student. With no formal web experience at the time, I wanted to create a space to share my resume, showcase a few CLI Java projects I was working on, and honor the memory of my mom, who had recently passed away that year.

## ðŸŒ± Why This Project Matters to Me

This site represents the beginning of my journey into software development. Looking back now, with over a decade of experience in the industry, Iâ€™m grateful for how far Iâ€™ve comeâ€”and proud of where it all started.

I'm uploading this project to GitHub 10 years later, not because it's perfect, but because itâ€™s honest. It's a reminder that we all start somewhereâ€”and that every `<div>` and `System.out.println()` matters.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Java (CLI programs referenced but not required to view the site)

## ðŸ“œ Pages Included

- **Resume Page** â€“ My college resume from 2014
- **Java Projects** â€“ CLI tools and small programs I built to teach myself Java
- **In Memory** â€“ A tribute page for my mom ðŸ’™

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts

This project reminds me that learning, building, and growing takes timeâ€”and that itâ€™s okay to look back with humility and a little nostalgia.

Thanks for checking it out.
